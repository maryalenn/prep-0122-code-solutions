[1]What does strictly equal mean?
    The strict equality operator (===) checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.

    If the operands are of different types, return false.
    If both operands are objects, return true only if they refer to the same object.
    If both operands are null or both operands are undefined, return true.
    If either operand is NaN, return false.

[2]What is the logical and operator?
    &&
    Example:
    (x < 10 && y > 1) is true


[3] Can you name some comparison operators?
        COMPARISON OPERATORS
        == Equal to
        === Equal Value AND Equal type
        != Not Equal
        !== Not Equal OR Not Equal type
        > Greater Than
        < Less Than
        >= Greater Than or Equal to
        <= Less Than or Equal To

        LOGICAL OPERATORS
        && and
        || or
        ! Not

**The if Statement

  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}

**(The else Statement
Use the else statement to specify a block of code to be executed if the condition is false.
