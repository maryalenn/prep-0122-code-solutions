1. What is the principal use of arrays?
  An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value

  An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

  **storing "list" type data**

2. Describe the syntax (structure) of array-literals in JavaScript.

  Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.

    Syntax:
    const array_name = [item1, item2, ...];

3. What number represents the first index of an array?
[0]

4. How can you access the last element of an array?
  //Example
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
    let fruit = fruits[fruits.length - 1];

***NOTES***
It has become a common practice to declare arrays using --const--

  Arrays are Not Constants
  The keyword const is a little misleading.

  It does NOT define a constant array. It defines a constant reference to an array.

  Because of this, we can still change the elements of a constant array.

The Difference Between Arrays and Objects
Arrays use numbered indexes.
Objects use named indexes.

PROPERTIES & METHODS

cars.length   // Returns the number of elements
cars.sort()   // Sorts the array

Accessing the First Array Element
//Example
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
    let fruit = fruits[0];

Accessing the Last Array Element
//Example
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
    let fruit = fruits[fruits.length - 1];

Looping Array Elements
One way to loop through an array, is using a for loop:
//Example
    const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
    let fLen = fruits.length;

    let text = "<ul>";
    for (let i = 0; i < fLen; i++) {
      text += "<li>" + fruits[i] + "</li>";
    }
    text += "</ul>";
